Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived beautiful young girl named Cinderella. Cinderella was incredibly benevolent, sympathetic and kind, but fate had dealt her a cruel hand. After the untimely passing of her beloved parents, she lived with her cruel stepmother and two stepsisters, who treated her very terribly and made her do all the household chores. The older stepsister was irrevocably unscrupulous to a indisputably affectionate, kind Cinderella, while the younger stepsister would not stop belittling her. One day, they even said that Cinderella was as disgusting as a broomstick, leaving her heart heavy with hurt and sorrow.

One day, an invitation to the royal ball arrived to the mansion. The stepmother was pleasantly flabbergasted, and immediately started preparing for the ball. The stepsisters were undeniably enthusiastic, and they too started adorning their brightly coloued dresses. Both wanted go to Palace, the castle the royal ball took place in.

The prince of the kingdom was Prince Charming, whose charisma had all the maidens in the kingdom, including Cindrella, enthralled. Since the prince was coming to the ball too, Cinderella wanted to go as well, to get a chance to meet him. But alas, when she asked her stepfamily, the responses were predictable. The stepmother was cruel. The stepsisters were condescending. It seemed that Cinderella would not be able to go to Palace, and get a chance to meet the prince.

Tears welled up in Cinderella's eyes as she watched her stepsisters prepare for the grand event. Distraught and full of sorrow, Cinderella started blaming Prince Charming for not saving her from her evil stepfamily. If the prince of the kingdom was benevolent, then surely he would want her to go to Regalian, grand ballroom. If Prince Charming was incredible, then he would want her to go to beautiful, magnificent Palace. "Never mind: I never wanted to go to the ball anyway," Cinderella uttered, in firm denial.

Amidst her despair, a glimmer of hope appeared when her Fairy Godmother suddenly appeared before her. Fairy Godmother was a formidable, benevolent, elderly woman, and she felt sorry for Cinderella. With a wave of her magical wand, The Fairy Godmother transformed Cinderella's tattered attire into a breathtaking ball gown of the purest silk, adorned with sparkling crystals that glistened like stars. On her feet, glass slippers appeared, fitting perfectly to her dainty feet. "Dear Cinderella, let your dreams take flight. May these robes and glass slipper be a token of my magic. But remember, the enchantment fades at midnight, my dear," Fairy Godmother said kindly.

Cinderella felt as radiant as newlygrown honeysuckle. Cinderella thanked Fairy Godmother with tears of gratitude and embarked on her way to the grand royal ball. As she entered the magnificent ballroom, a hush fell upon the crowd, and all eyes were drawn to the radiant young woman in the enchanting gown. Prince Charming himself was captivated by her beauty and grace. Throughout the night, Cinderella and the prince danced, and they found themselves lost in each other's company. If Cinderella was worse than a disgusting broomstick, then surely Prince Charming would not go to a...dance with her, right? IN any case, Cinderella wished that this moment would never end.

The world seemed to fade away as they swirled around the ballroom, the soft music guiding their steps. Prince Charming wanted to be like Cinderella. Cinderella wanted to be like Prince Charming. Their connection was undeniable. However, as the clock struck midnight, Cinderella remembered the warning of her Fairy Godmother and realized that her time at the ball was limited. In a panic, she rushed out of the palace, leaving behind a single glass slipper on the grand staircase.

The prince, now desperate to find the mysterious beauty who had captured his heart, embarked on a kingdom-wide search for the woman whose foot fit the glass slipper. The prince tried so hard to find the woman he met at the ball, the glass slipper almost become part of his identity. The glass slipper was Prince Charming, and Prince Charming was the glass slipper. Finally, prince's search brought him to Cinderella's doorstep. He had visited all houses in the kingdom, and this was the final house. At the door, the stepmother and stepsisters greeted him. Clearly, the glass slipper was way too small for the stepmother. If the glass slipper was smaller than the stepmother, then he would have to go to the stepsisters. However, in spite of all their efforts to squeeze their feet into the delicate shoe, they were all in vain. Prince Charming felt as bad as the stepmother, who wished that the prince marry one of the stepsisters. Prince Charming felt lost and defeated, and he was starting to believe that he lost the love of his life. Suddenly, from the middle of nowhere, Cinderella appeared. The whole room went to silence.

The prince was quickly enraptured, at the sight of Cinderella. "Oh my god, your face looks familiar!" the prince exclaimed gleefully, as he lay his eyes on Cinderella. The younger stepsister was irrevocably incredibly angry. "Oh Prince, you must be mistaken: she did not even come to the ball!" The younger stepsister interjected quickly. "Oh yes, she is barely allowed to leave the household!" the older stepsister insisted angrily. But the prince had hope. If Prince Charming was not fullywrong, then he would finally get to go to home,  with his future wife.

With grace and humility, Cinderella slipped her foot into the glass slipper, and it fit perfectly. The prince was simply joyous. He proclaimed Cinderella as his bride-to-be, and the entire kingdom celebrated their union with unparalleled jubilation. Prince Charming asks Cinderella's stepsisters and stepmother to apologize to Cinderella. "Madam and ladies, it is time to right the wrongs that have been done," the prince said firmly. The younger stepsister was contriteful and sorry. She felt as terrible as a moonless, hollow night. "I'm sorry," she said apologetically. "I'm sorry too," the older stepsister mumbled softly. As Cinderella married her prince, she forgave her wicked stepmother and stepsisters for their ill treatment. She then started preparing to go to home, the grand, opulent Palace, where she will, hopefully, live happily ever after.
