Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived beautiful young girl named Cinderella. Cinderella was incredibly benevolent, sympathetic and kind, but fate had dealt her a cruel hand. After the untimely passing of her beloved parents, she lived with her cruel stepmother and two stepsisters, who treated her very terribly and made her do all the household chores. The older stepsister was irrevocably unscrupulous to a indisputably affectionate, kind Cinderella. 

One day, an invitation to the royal ball arrived to the mansion. The stepmother was pleasantly flabbergasted, and immediately started preparing for the ball. The stepsisters were undeniably enthusiastic, and they too started adorning their brightly coloued dresses. Both wanted go to Palace, the castle the royal ball took place in.

The prince of the kingdom was Prince Charming. The stepmother was cruel. The stepsisters were condescending. Cindrella wanted to go to Palace, too.

If the prince of the kingdom was benevolent, then surely he would want her to go to Regalian, grand ballroom. If Prince Charming was incredible, then he would want her to go to beautiful, magnificent Palace. "This is even more amazing!" Cinderella said.

Fairy Godmother was a formidable, benevolent, elderly woman. "I never thought this could be the end," Fairy Godmother said charmingly.

Cinderella felt as radiant as newlygrown honeysuckle. If Cinderella was worse than a disgusting broomstick, then surely Prince Charming would not go to a...dance with her, right? Cinderella wished that this moment would never end.

Prince Charming wanted to be like Cinderella.

The shoes were Prince Charming. If the shoes was smaller than the stepmother, then he would have to resort to going to the stepsisters. Prince Charming felt as bad as the stepmother. In the middle of nowhere, Cinderella appeared. The noisy room suddenly went to silence.

The prince was quickly enraptured. "Oh my god, your face looks familiar!" the prince exclaimed gleefully, as he lay his eyes on Cinderella. The younger stepsister was irrevocably incredibly angry. "Hi," The younger stepsister said amazingly. "Hi," the older stepsister interjected angrily. If Prince Charming was not fullywrong, then he would finally get to go to home.

The prince was simply joyous. "Hi," the prince said confidently. The younger stepsister was contriteful and sorry. She felt as terrible as a moonless, hollow night. "Hi," she said apologetically. "I'm sorry too," the older stepsister mumbled softly. going to home, and they lived happily ever after.
